# Summary of What We've Created
We've successfully created a comprehensive PEG parser library called TinyPEG, along with detailed documentation and examples. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

### Core Library Components core.py:** 
Contains the fundamental classes for parsing, including Expression, Reference, ParserContext, and ParseError.
 - **parsers.py:** Provides the PEGParser and Rule classes for building parsers.
 - **syntax_tree.py:** Defines the GrammarNode and DebugVisitor classes for representing and traversing syntax trees.

### Example Parsers
 - **Calculator Parser:** Parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.
 - **If Statement Parser:** Parses if statements in a programming language.
 - **While Loop Parser:** Parses while loops in a programming language.
 - **EmLang Parser:** Parses a simple programming language with variables and print statements.
 - **TinyCL Parser:** A complete tiny programming language with variables, control structures, and basic I/O.

### Documentation Preface:
Introduction to parsing and grammar concepts.
- **Chapter 1:** Understanding PEG Parsers - covers the theory and concepts behind PEGs.
- **Chapter 2:** TinyPEG Library Overview - details the architecture and components of the library.
- **Chapter 3:** Building Your First Parser - walks through creating a simple parser.
- **Chapter 4:** Example Parsers - explores the example parsers included with the library.
- **Chapter 5:** Creating a Tiny Programming Language - guides through building a complete language.
- **Appendices:** Provide reference material on PEG grammar, testing, and the TinyCL language. 
 
### Tests
- test_core.py: Tests for the core components.
- test_parsers.py: Tests for the parser components.
- test_syntax_tree.py: Tests for the syntax tree components.
- test_tinycl.py: Tests for the TinyCL language parser and interpreter.

### TinyCL Language**
We've implemented a complete tiny programming language called TinyCL with:

Variables and assignments
Arithmetic operations
Control structures (if statements and while loops)
Print statements for output
Comments
The TinyCL implementation includes:

A parser that builds an AST
An interpreter that executes TinyCL programs
Example programs demonstrating the language's features
Next Steps
To further enhance the TinyPEG library and TinyCL language, you could:

Implement Memoization: Add packrat parsing to improve performance.
Add More PEG Operators: Implement additional operators like zero-or-more (*), one-or-more (+), and optional (?).
Enhance Error Reporting: Improve error messages to help users debug their grammars.
Add Semantic Actions: Allow users to attach actions to grammar rules.
Extend TinyCL: Add functions, more data types, and a richer standard library.
Create a Web Interface: Build a web-based playground for experimenting with the library.
This project provides a solid foundation for understanding and working with parsing expression grammars, and can be extended in many directions based on your interests and needs.
